## First Time Set Up 
This section is adapted from Kate Miller and Sarah Wright's IMD Training on [Version Control](https://katemmiller.github.io/IMD_R_Training_Advanced/) 

### 1. Set Up a Github Account 

Go to [Join Github](https://github.com/join) to get started! 

This [Wiki How](https://www.wikihow.com/Create-an-Account-on-GitHub) gives in depth instructions on how to set up your account if you're having trouble 

Once you've completed this step please *email your username to Sam (samantha_olivares-mejia@partner.nps.gov)* so she can add you to our training github page! 

#### 2. Open R Studio 

#### 3. Navigate to **Tools > Global Options** 
  a. On the list on the left, click on GIT SVN
  b. Make sure the 'Enable version interface for RStudio project box is checked 
  c. Your screen should look like this (git.exe path may differ)

  d. Click Apply then OK 
  
#### 4. Create a Personal Access Token 
Your personal access token is used to connect your Github account to RStudio.
  a. run the code below in R Studio which will open a web browser to create a personal access token 
  
```{r MakeGHToken, eval=FALSE}
# This opens up a browser window where you can create a personal access token. It may ask you to log into GitHub or confirm your password.
usethis::create_github_token()
``` 
  
  b. once you've logged into GitHub your page will look like this

  c. enter 'RStudio' in the ***Note** field 
  d. set the **expiration** to a later date (I'd reccommend a year)
  e. scroll to the bottom and click **generate token** 
  f. this code will only generate once so make sure you **copy the personal access token to your clipboard**!!! 

#### 5. Insert your personal access token in the Git Credential Store 
  a. run the code below and when prompted paste your personal access token 

```{SetGHCreds, eval=FALSE}
gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
```

## Github Overview 
Git/Github is a type of **version control** which is a way to save your progress in an organized manner. It allows you to keep track of your changes every step of the way, and allows for easy collaboration between teams. 

Git and Github are used interchangebly, however they are two sperate entities. 

  **Git** is the software you install on your computer 
  **GitHub** is an online interface for storing and collaborating with code.

## Branch and Clone Repository

### Branch 

First we are going to create a branch from main. To do this, go to the [SWNC Learning Github Repository](https://github.com/sam-olivares-mejia/SWNC_Learning_Github). 

If you've emailed Sam your GitHub username you should have contributor access to the repository. 

Click on the **main dropdown** in the upper left, and begin typing your name separated by underscores. Once complete, click on **'Create branch:*your name* from main'**. This will create your branch! 

```{r createbranch, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}
include_graphics("images/CreateBranch.png")
```

### Clone the Repository

1. Click on **code** in the upper right, and copy the HTTPS url provided. 

```{r CloneRepo, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}
include_graphics("images/CloneRepo.png")
```

2. Open R Studio and go to **File>NewProject>VersionControl>Git** 

3. Paste the repository URL and click OK. Congrats- you have now cloned the repository to your local computer!
