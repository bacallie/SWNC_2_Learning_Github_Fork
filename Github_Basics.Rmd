## First Time Set Up 
This section is adapted from Kate Miller and Sarah Wright's IMD Training on [Version Control](https://katemmiller.github.io/IMD_R_Training_Advanced/) 

### 1. Install Git
  Git is the software needed for this learning session.If you do not already have Git installed on your computer, please install before the session.  
  
  a. Open the **Software Center** application on your computer (this will allow you to download without admin approval)
  b. Navigate to the **Applications** tab 
  c. Click on **Git** 
  d. Click Install

### 2. Set Up a Github Account 

Go to [Join Github](https://github.com/join) to get started! 

This [Wiki How](https://www.wikihow.com/Create-an-Account-on-GitHub) gives in depth instructions on how to set up your account if you're having trouble 

Once you've completed this step please **email your username to Sam (samantha_olivares-mejia@partner.nps.gov)** so she can add you to our training github page! 

### 3. Open R Studio and install the `usethis` package 
  Remember, to install packages we use the install.packages() function. You can type this in the Console (lower left panel) with "usethis" inside the parenthesis.

ex: install.packages("usethis")

### 4. Navigate to **Tools > Global Options** 
  a. On the list on the left, click on GIT SVN
  b. Make sure the 'Enable version interface for RStudio project box is checked 
  c. Your screen should look like this (git.exe path may differ)

  d. Click Apply then OK 
  
### 5. Create a Personal Access Token 
Your personal access token is used to connect your Github account to RStudio.
  a. run the code below in R Studio which will open a web browser to create a personal access token 
  
```{r MakeGHToken, eval=FALSE}
# This opens up a browser window where you can create a personal access token. It may ask you to log into GitHub or confirm your password.
usethis::create_github_token()
``` 
  
  b. once you've logged into GitHub your page will look like this

  c. enter 'RStudio' in the ***Note** field 
  d. set the **expiration** to a later date (I'd reccommend a year)
  e. scroll to the bottom and click **generate token** 
  f. this code will only generate once so make sure you **copy the personal access token to your clipboard**!!! 

### 6. Insert your personal access token in the Git Credential Store 
  a. run the code below and when prompted paste your personal access token 

```{SetGHCreds, eval=FALSE}
gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
```

## Github Overview 

### Git vs. GitHub
Git/Github is a type of **version control** which is a way to save your progress in an organized manner. It allows you to keep track of your changes every step of the way, and allows for easy collaboration between teams. 

Git and Github are used interchangeably, however they are two sperate entities. 

  **Git** is the software you install on your computer 
  **GitHub** is an online interface for storing and collaborating with code.  

### Some terminology

## Branch and Clone Repository

### Branch 

First we are going to create a branch from main. To do this, go to the [SWNC Learning Github Repository](https://github.com/sam-olivares-mejia/SWNC_Learning_Github). 

If you've emailed Sam your GitHub username you should have contributor access to the repository. 

Click on the **main dropdown** in the upper left, and begin typing your name separated by underscores. Once complete, click on **'Create branch:*your name* from main'**. This will create your branch! 

```{r createbranch, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}
include_graphics("images/CreateBranch.png")
```

### Clone the Repository

1. Click on **code** in the upper right, and copy the HTTPS url provided. 

```{r CloneRepo, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}
include_graphics("images/CloneRepo.png")
```

2. Open R Studio and go to **File>NewProject>VersionControl>Git** 

```{r CloneRepoWorkflow, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}
include_graphics("images/CloneRepoWorkflow.png")
```

3. Paste the repository URL and click **Create Project**. Congrats- you have now cloned the repository to your local computer! 

### Open Branch 

To switch to your branch of the repository, navigate to the Git Panel in RStudio. It should be located in the upper right panel next to your environment. If it is not there you can go to **View >ShowGit** to view it.

Click the drop down menu in the upper right and select your branch name to switch to your branch!  

```{r SwitchBranches, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="50%"}
include_graphics("images/SwitchBranch.png")
```
