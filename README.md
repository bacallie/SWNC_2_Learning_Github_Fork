# SWNC_Learning_Github
This Github repository (repo) will be used for a GitHub basics workshop.

The ReadMe file is used to provide background to your project.
Like we learned in the last course, the readme file uses **Markdown formatting**

Before this session please install Git on your computer and create a Github Account if you haven't already. 
Details on both tasks can be found in the 'First Time Set Up' Section of the Github_Basics.html
